# PNEUMONIA DETECTION USING NON LINEAR SVM WITH RBF KERNEL

This project aims to create a machine learning model to detect pneumonia disease from x-ray chest images


## Library requirements
The library requirements for the code are the following:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Pillow
- cv2
- Matplotlib



## DATASET

The dataset is composed of 5573 chest x-ray images taken from Kaggle website . 80 % of the dataset is used as training set while the remaining 20 % is used as test set. Different image preprocessing methods are applied and evaluated.


## HOW TO RUN
In order to run the files , changing paths inside the code is needed. The code part consists of only one file named pneumonia_detection_using_nonlinear_svm.py
## RESULTS
The SVM model is able to correctly classifies almost 94% of the examples in the test set (cv 5 cross validation). Overall performances are :
- Accuracy : 0.94;
- Precision : 0.95;
- Recall :  0.96;
- F-1 score  : 0.96.
